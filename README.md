# Unity scripts

A series of modular components and other scripts that I often use in across different projects.

## Animation

A simple animation system for when the build-in animation is to much for what you want to achieve and when a much simpler system works too.

## Camera

Components adding functionality the standard camera component.

## Device

Static and globally accessable classes that deal with the device.

## Interface

Components that deal with the interface's behaviour.

## Player

Components that deal with the player's behaviour.

## Log.cs

A static and globally accessable logging class which passes its calls onto Unity's build-in logging system, however it requires the "LOGGING_ENABLED" flag to be set in the "Scripting Define Symbols" player settings. This allows the logging system the be easily disabled in release build of a game.
